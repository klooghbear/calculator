//My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an "=" corresponding id

//My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDS id = zero, id = one, id = two, id = three, id = four, id = five id = six, id = seven, id = eight, id = nice

//My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements containg one of the 4 primary operators with the following corresponding IDS id = add, id = subtract, id = multiple, id = divide

//My calculator should contain a clickable element contaning a decimal point symbol witha  conrresponding id = decimal

//My calculator should contain a clickable element with an id = clear

//My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding id = display

//At any present time, pressing the clear button cleas the input and output values, and retirn the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display

//As i input numbers, i should be able to see my input in the elemnet with the id of display

//In any order, I should be able to add, stubtract, multiply, and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and whien I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display

//When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with mupltiple zeros

//When the decimal element is clicked, a should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.

//I should be able to perform and opeation (+, - , *. /) on numbers containing decimal points

//If 2 or more operatirs are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-)sign). For example if 5 + * 7 = is entered the result should be 35 (ie 5*7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered the result should be -25(ie. 5 * (-5))

//Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation

//My Calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding ( note that there is no exact standard, but your should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places
